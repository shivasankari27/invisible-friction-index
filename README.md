# Invisible Friction Index

This project models student failure and burnout as a consequence of academic schedule design,
not individual weakness.

Using a public Kaggle student performance dataset, we engineer timetable-like features to
construct an Invisible Friction Index and show via ablation that design-level friction adds
predictive value beyond standard student covariates.
